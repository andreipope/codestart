# Learning Paths

At CodeStart, we are committed to expanding our range of educational offerings to encompass a variety of programming languages. Each series of courses, known as a "path," is designed to guide you through the intricacies and nuances of a specific programming language, ensuring a comprehensive understanding from the basics to advanced topics. Currently, we offer the "Python Path," and we are actively working on developing additional paths. Stay tuned for more dynamic and robust learning paths coming your way!
