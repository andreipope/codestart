# Simple games

Welcome! This module is designed to provide a fun and engaging introduction to Python programming for beginners. By creating simple yet entertaining games, you'll learn the basics of Python while enjoying the process of coding.

In this module, we'll focus on two classic games: a Number Guessing Game and Rock, Paper, Scissors. These games are carefully chosen to teach you fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as input/output operations, control structures, random number generation, user input handling, game logic, and basic error handling.

## Number Guessing Game

In the Number Guessing Game, you will learn how to:

- **Basic Input/Output:** Understand how to interact with users by taking input from the keyboard and displaying output on the screen.
- **Control Structures: If-else Statements:** Learn how to make decisions in your code using if-else statements, a crucial part of any programming language.
- **Random Number Generation:** Dive into generating random numbers, an essential aspect of many games and a useful tool in programming.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

In the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, you will explore:

- **Handling User Input:** Master the art of reading and processing user input to respond to player choices.
- **Implementing Game Logic:** Develop the core logic of the game, which is fundamental in making any game functional and enjoyable.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Understand how to handle unexpected or erroneous user input gracefully, a key skill in building robust applications.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you'll have a solid foundation in basic Python programming concepts. You'll understand how to interact with users, make decisions in your code, and build the logic behind popular games. Moreover, you'll gain skills in writing clean and efficient Python code, setting a strong foundation for more advanced programming challenges.

Let's dive into the exciting world of Python with games that not only teach you the basics of programming but also provide a playful way to apply your new skills!
