# Simple games

Welcome! This module is designed to provide a fun and engaging introduction to Python programming for beginners. By creating simple yet entertaining games, you'll learn the basics of Python while enjoying the process of coding.

In this module, we'll focus on two classic games: a Number Guessing Game and Rock, Paper, Scissors. These games are carefully chosen to teach you fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as input/output operations, control structures, random number generation, user input handling, game logic, and basic error handling.

## Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is an interactive program that introduces you to foundational Python programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional statements through a simple game of guessing a computer-selected number. Completing the game provides practical experience in writing and executing Python code, solidifying your foundational knowledge in programming.
