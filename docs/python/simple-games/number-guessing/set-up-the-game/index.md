# Set Up the Game

This section shows how you can start putting together your very first game! Think of it as gathering all the tools and ingredients you need before you start cooking a meal. First, you'll learn about **functions**, which are like individual instructions or recipes that tell the game what to do. Then, you'll explore **standard modules**, which are like pre-made tools or ingredients that Python gives you to make coding easier. Finally, you'll dive into the **random module**, a special tool in Python that helps you make the game unpredictable and fun by generating random numbers. Don't worry if you don't know much about coding yet; we'll explain everything step by step!
