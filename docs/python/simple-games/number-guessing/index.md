# Number Guessing

This lesson introduces the Number Guessing Game, a simple interactive program designed for beginners to learn foundational Python programming concepts. The game involves guessing a random number chosen by the computer within a defined range.

## Objective

The objective of the Number Guessing Game is to familiarize new programmers with basic Python syntax and concepts, including variables, loops, input handling, and conditional statements, through the development and execution of a simple game.

## Game Description

In the Number Guessing Game, the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to guess the number, receiving feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

## Learning Outcomes

Participants will achieve the following by completing this game:

1. **Understand basic Python syntax:** Learn how Python scripts are structured, including the use of functions, loops, and conditional statements.
2. **Grasp core programming concepts:** Develop a foundational understanding of variables, user input, loop control, and feedback mechanisms.
3. **Implement and run Python code:** Gain practical experience writing and executing Python code through an interactive script.
